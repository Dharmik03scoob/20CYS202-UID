<p>Initially i suffered a lot with the subject of chemistry but later realized that it is a beautiful subject. What's happens with every student in chemistry is ...,
Faculty teach chemistry in such a way that students will mug up the concepts in the subject.I accept that some of the basic concepts such as remembering atomic no's and their 
mass no's till 30 . This is the basic one every teacher will do with the students from the start of the subject . This makes the student to think like we have to remember the concepts 
in chemistry . This is a wrong assumption coz there are lot of concepts to understand in the chemistry. This forms the base for every student in the chemistry .<p>

<p></br></br>My suggestion is to follow every NCERT chemistry book . This book has lot of value but most of the students neglect to study it thoroughly . In this book , every concept will 
be explained with a real life example , No need to refer any other books . Becoz of this , I follow NCERT to strengthen your basics in chemistry. Most of the students doesn't strengthen their 
basics and when coming to higher classes , they suffer a lot feeling like chemistry is a difficult subject.In the secondary education , basically faculty teaches mole concept and this is most 
important concept in higher secondary education . Do more problems on mole concept and understand the concept , This eases you in studying physical chemistry.</p>
<p></br></br><p> I recommend all of the students to practice more problems and different models to strengthen  physical chemistry concepts . Most of the secondary education deals with 
physical chemistry and inorganic chemistry . Let me tell you something about the inorganic chemistry , This is the most ugliest part of chemistry because there will be logical concepts 
related to inorganic chemistry . You guys have to read more theory and remember more equations but i didn't say that they aren't anything to understand . You have to read more 
reference books .</br></br></br><center>Follow this "Read one book many times, don't read many books at a  time"</center></p></div>

<p></br></br>Now comes my favourite part of chemistry, Organic chemistry . First this part of chemistry contains more understandable concepts. First of all i have studied this part in
my higher secondary classes (After my 10th). In this part of chemistry , follow the order of topics  Or else you will get pissed off with this. Find the best faculty who teaches this .
As i was taught by the best faculty , I loved this part more . Every one doesn't get the availability of best faculty who teaches this subject . There are some open source 
websites which are way popular to study organic chemistry . Let me give the links and references</p></br></br>
